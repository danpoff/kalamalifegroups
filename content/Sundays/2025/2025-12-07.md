- **Questions:**
  - Does Isaiah’s vision of the “peaceable kingdom” apply to nations today? If so, how? If not, why? ([Isa 11:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+11%3A6-7&version=NIV))
  - Why did John the Baptist preach such stern warnings? Do they apply to us today? Why or why not? ([Matt 3:7-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+3%3A7-12&version=NIV))
  - What is it like to imagine God’s kingdom as fragile or precarious as a tiny shoot, a broken grass blade, or a sputtering flame? What is happening in your life that might also resemble these images? If God can do “so much with so little,” what might you dare to hope for?
