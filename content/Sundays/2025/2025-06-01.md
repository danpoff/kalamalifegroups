**He Asks That They Be One**
*by Scott L. Barton*

> He asks that they be one just as  
> The Father and he are one;  
> It's not an idle prayer, because  
> It seems we've only begun  
> To realize just what he means—  
> He never meant to divide;  
> The love that opens you to pain  
> Is love which is bona fide.  
> The day will come when you and I  
> Will never, by faith, condemn;  
> But each will know the other just  
> As Christ made God known to them.
