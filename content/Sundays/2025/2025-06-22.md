- **Questions:**
  - The healed man begged to go with Jesus, but Jesus gave him a different commission: stay here and tell the people how much God has done for you. How do you communicate how much God has done for you in the place where you live (Luke 8:26-39)?
  - God comes to Elijah in the “sheer silence” (1 Kings 19: 11-15). It’s hard to hear the voice of God if you don’t take time for quiet. Where do you find rest and reflection?
