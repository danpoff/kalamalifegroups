We love church. We come from a variety of churches, but we are not a church. Some describe us as a community organization. We describe ourselves as a movement comprised of a network of small groups in businesses and homes that exist to spread the gospel. We believe that in order to reach unbelievers, we need to reach them where they do life.

Our leaders start groups in the places where they live and work. Each organic group is uniquely established to serve the needs of those in the local setting. Each group is alike in that each finds specific ways to practice the core values of Love like Jesus, live like Jesus and lead like Jesus. Because these are our core values, loving and serving God and others is who we are. Life Groups are the primary place of worship for some people and others participate in both Life Groups and traditional churches.



### How we are different:

You will not find us on a map because we are in many different places.

We are Kingdom volunteers, so we have very little overhead which allows one hundred percent of tithes and offerings go directly to the ministries we serve.

Our people also generously give money and time directly to those who express a need in our community, whether they are a part of our groups or not. It is one of the ways we show the love of Jesus to unbelievers.
