We come from a variety of churches, but we are not a church. Some describe us as a community organization. We describe ourselves as a movement comprised of a network of small groups in businesses and homes that exist to spread the gospel. We believe that in order to reach unbelievers, we need to reach them where they do life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our leaders start groups in the places where they live and work. Each organic group is uniquely established to serve the needs of those in the local setting. Each group is alike in that each finds specific ways to practice the core values of Love like Jesus, live like Jesus and lead like Jesus. Because these are our core values, loving and serving God and others is who we are. Life Groups are the primary place of worship for some people and others participate in both Life Groups and traditional churches.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beliefs</title><link>https://kalamalifegroups.org/beliefs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kalamalifegroups.org/beliefs/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>TRIUNE GOD: We believe in one God eternal, the Creator of all things, revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>JESUS CHRIST: We believe in Jesus Christ, who is fully God and fully man at the same time, who was born, lived, taught, died, and was raised back to life all to be the ransom for our sin.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ATONEMENT: We believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross and that, by trusting in His death, we can be restored to a right relation to God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HOLY SPIRIT: We believe in the Holy Spirit, who is ever-present and always active in the world, guides us into salvation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>THE BIBLE: We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, giving us all we need to know about how to be saved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SINFUL NATURE: We believe that we are all sinners by both nature and act and need God’s forgiveness and cleansing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SALVATION: We believe that each person must repent, turn away from sin, and trust Christ in order to be saved.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>JUSTIFICATION: We believe that when we turn from sin and trust in Christ, the old record of sin is wiped clean, and we are born anew, thus becoming part of the family of God.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>HOLINESS: We believe that after salvation, God desires each individual to be fully submitted in thoughts, attitudes, decisions, emotions, and lifestyle to the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit. When we make a complete commitment to God, God cleanses our spirit, fills us with God’s perfect love, and gives us the power to live victoriously.&lt;/li>
