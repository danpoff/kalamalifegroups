              <p class="text-left">
                We love church. We come from a variety of churches, but we are not a church.
                Some describe us as a community organization.
                We describe ourselves as a movement comprised of a network of small groups in businesses and homes that
                exist to spread the gospel.
                We believe that in order to reach unbelievers, we need to reach them where they do life.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                Our leaders start groups in the places where they live and work.
                Each organic group is uniquely established to serve the needs of those in the local setting.
                Each group is alike in that each finds specific ways to practice the core values of Love like Jesus,
                live like Jesus and lead like Jesus.
                Because these are our core values, loving and serving God and others is who we are.
                Life Groups are the primary place of worship for some people and others participate in both Life Groups
                and traditional churches.
              </p>
              <hr class="divider my-4">
              <h5 class="text-center">How we are different:</h5>
              <p class="text-left">
                You will not find us on a map because we are in many different places.
              </p class="text-left">
              <p class="text-left">
                We do not pass an offering plate, and we will not ask you for money.
                For participants who belong to a traditional church, we ask them to give all of their tithe money to
                that church.
                For the others, we ask them to seek God’s calling on which ministries He is leading them to, and then to
                give directly to those groups or ministries.
                One hundred percent of gifts to our groups go directly to the ministries.
                This is how we fund our work and it provides complete transparency in how your gift is spent.
              </p>
              <p class="text-left">
                Our people also generously give money and time directly to those who express a need in our community,
                whether they are a part of our groups or not.
                It is one of the ways we show the love of Jesus to unbelievers.

              <h3 class="text-center">Beliefs:</h3>
              <ul class="text-left">
                <li>TRIUNE GOD: We believe in one God eternal, the Creator of all things, revealed as Father, Son, and
                  Holy Spirit.</li>
                <li>JESUS CHRIST: We believe in Jesus Christ, who is fully God and fully man at the same time, who was
                  born, lived, taught, died, and was raised back to life all to be the ransom for our sin.</li>
                <li>ATONEMENT: We believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross and that, by trusting in His death, we can
                  be restored to a right relation to God.</li>
                <li>HOLY SPIRIT: We believe in the Holy Spirit, who is ever-present and always active in the world,
                  guides us into salvation.</li>
                <li>THE BIBLE: We believe that the Bible is the Word of God, giving us all we need to know about how to
                  be saved.</li>
                <li>SINFUL NATURE: We believe that we are all sinners by both nature and act and need God’s forgiveness
                  and cleansing.</li>
                <li>SALVATION: We believe that each person must repent, turn away from sin, and trust Christ in order to
                  be saved.</li>
                <li>JUSTIFICATION: We believe that when we turn from sin and trust in Christ, the old record of sin is
                  wiped clean, and we are born anew, thus becoming part of the family of God.</li>
                <li>HOLINESS: We believe that after salvation, God desires each individual to be fully submitted in
                  thoughts, attitudes, decisions, emotions, and lifestyle to the power and guidance of the Holy Spirit.
                  When we make a complete commitment to God, God cleanses our spirit, fills us with God’s perfect love,
                  and gives us the power to live victoriously.</li>
